# Decision Log - Rate Importer

## Technical Decisions

### [2025-06-07 15:00:00] - Splink Integration Paused
**Decision**: Pause Splink PostgreSQL backend integration
**Rationale**: 
- Splink 4.x removed PostgreSQL backend support
- Splink 3.9.x (latest with Postgres support) has broken/incomplete implementation on PyPI
- Multiple attempts to fix imports and engine passing failed
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Downgrading Python version (tried, didn't work)
- Using different Splink versions (3.8.1 lacks Postgres, 3.9.7 broken)
- Hardcoding connection strings (didn't resolve engine type errors)
**Implications**: Need alternative deduplication solution or wait for upstream fixes

### [2025-06-07 15:30:00] - Backend Architecture for Validation
**Decision**: Consider using Strapi CMS as validation backend
**Rationale**:
- User already has Strapi in tech stack
- Provides built-in CRUD, validation, RBAC, and admin UI
- Faster development than custom backend
- Can be extended with custom validation logic
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom Python backend
- Custom Node.js backend
- Other OSS backends (Hasura, Supabase, Directus)
**Implications**: May need hybrid approach for complex ML validation

### [2025-06-07 16:00:00] - Windsurf Automation Strategy
**Decision**: Implement full automation with minimal interruptions
**Rationale**:
- User preference for proactive automation
- Reduces context switching
- Speeds up development workflow
**Implications**: Auto-create files, auto-run safe commands, auto-update memory bank
