Optimize Rate-Importer performance for crawler and data processing.

Steps:
1. Profile current performance bottlenecks
2. Analyze crawler efficiency and concurrent requests
3. Optimize database queries and add caching
4. Implement queue system for async processing
5. Add Redis for session/cache management
6. Optimize Docker images (multi-stage builds)
7. Implement CDN for static assets
8. Add performance monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
9. Load test with realistic data volumes
10. Document performance improvements and benchmarks
